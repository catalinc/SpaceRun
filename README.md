# Title

Andromeda Run - A space shooter game.

# Description

Is the year 3049 and humanity spread through galaxy. You are Garth, a brave explorer seeking new 
planets suitable for life to establish new colonies. You were happily exploring the galaxy when an 
unknown alien race had attacked your ship and took you (and your ship) to their home for study.
Even worse, their home is in Andromeda galaxy. By ingenuity you manage somehow to break free from
their prison, regain control of your ship and flee. But the aliens are not happy with this and they
are in pursuit trying to catch you and bring you back to their prison. You are jumping from system
to system in the Andromeda galaxy searching for a worm hole to your home galaxy and back to safety.

# Controls

Screen orientation is horizontal. Virtual joystick for up/down on the left side of the screen.
Two buttons for firing laser and dropping bombs on the right side of the screen.

# Game play

Each system is a game level. There will be 10 levels in total. At the end of each level there will
be a boss fight where the boss is a big bad-ass alien ship. Each level will feature new types of
aliens. Each new level will be harder to beat due to increase difficulty. As you progress the aliens
will become harder and harder to kill and their weapons' damage will increase. Need a math formula
here to compute the values for life/shield and damage for aliens for each level.
During the game you will find alien technology and you will use it to upgrade your weapons and shields.
